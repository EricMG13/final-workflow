# Offline Issuer Library

A local application for preparing issuer runs, launching the existing CP-OS
workflow, screening dated results and reading deliverables in one interface.
The library reads historical evidence; New run writes fresh intake, execution and
delivery folders. Candidate output remains explicitly qualified.

## Windows: double-click launch

1. Extract the entire Windows ZIP and keep the executable beside its `engine` folder.
   Choose the appropriate Windows ZIP (amd64 for Intel/AMD, arm64 for Windows on ARM).
2. Double-click **Issuer Library.exe**. It opens the default browser and runs
   only on `127.0.0.1`. No Python, Node, installation downloads or internet are needed.
   The browser is signed in to this launch only (see **Local session** below).
3. In **Settings** on the left rail, enter the full folder containing `runs/` and
   `deliverables/`, then choose **Save and reload**. The default is the Windows
   Documents known folder plus `FinalWorkflow`; existing folders are not moved.
4. The rail reaches every part of the one app: Issuer library, Research workspace,
   Reports, Run activity, New run, Search (`/`), Settings and Help. Choose a run
   in the library to read its overview, modules, calendar, reports and evidence. A report
   opens inside the app beside that navigation; its **Built from** list opens the
   module outputs it used, and a module output links to the deliverables that used it.
   Discovery runs every 30 seconds; when it finds a change the app offers **Reload**.
   **Download original HTML** saves the standalone report.
5. **Quit library** in Settings stops the service. Closing a tab leaves it running.
   Launching the executable again asks its running per-user instance to quit: with no model
   run and no run review in flight it quits, and the new launch opens a fresh window. This is
   also the way back in when the browser has lost its session (cookies cleared, a private window
   closed). With a run or review in flight the library keeps running and the new launch says
   "Issuer Library is busy (1 run, 0 reviews); wait for it to finish, then start it again." (see
   **Relaunch** below). Quitting or changing workspace is refused while a model run is active.
   Switching to another workspace is also refused (409, "A run review is in progress…") while a
   run review writes into the current one, up to the 10-minute review bound however the review
   ends; saving the same workspace still works.

The Windows binaries are cross-compiled pilot builds, not signed enterprise
releases. Windows execution, browser rendering and enterprise rollout still need
Windows acceptance. IT can sign the executable and distribute it using its normal
software deployment process. No firewall opening or Windows service is needed.

## New run: context, issuer folder, review, Start

New run follows `src/deploy_workflow/owners/cpos_launch.py`, the same launcher as its
command line, and stays inside the app: moving elsewhere and back keeps what you entered.

1. Complete the Run context form or load a saved `context.json`. It sets the issuer,
   workflow and dates. Optional sections stay available in disclosures.
2. Choose the issuer folder (up to 500 files, 64 MiB each and 512 MiB in total). Choose
   a model and a maximum USD spend. **Advanced** narrows the modules (their dependencies
   are added) and sets the turns allowed per module. Office's `~$` lock files, beside a
   document someone has open, and Windows files such as `Thumbs.db` are listed as unread.
3. **Validate and review run** runs the launcher's offline preparation, with no provider
   call. Review shows the modules in order, the model and effort, the spend ceiling, what
   one call holds while in flight, the file hashes, the files no module can read, the
   report sections this run fills and those it does not. A refusal writes nothing. A run
   needs about 140 characters of path below the workspace folder; where Windows long paths
   are off, review refuses a workspace too deep for that, before any spend.
4. Approve it, then choose **Start run**. The application starts one CP-OS worker.
   Duplicate Start requests cannot create another execution. Changed files, context,
   instructions, workflow code or review invalidate the approval.
5. Follow the module in progress, the last accepted module and recorded spend. Recent runs stay listed after
   reopening the page. The progress step is headed by the run's issuer, workflow, date and id. Recent runs
   lists every run in the workspace with its workflow, module, state and spend; opening
   a row shows its progress. A rejected module stops the run: its work is kept and no automatic
   paid retry is made. A finished run opens on its deliverables. Automated checks cover
   structure, anchors and report selectors only: review the handoffs against the sources
   before relying on a report. The launcher publishes the report; it does not publish an
   HTML Model, charts or calculation JSON.

Preparing and validating inputs works offline. Live model execution requires its
configured provider connection and credentials in the **launching environment**:
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. The application never
asks for or stores provider keys in a file. IT should provide those environment
variables through its approved launch mechanism; restart the app after changes.
Missing configuration keeps Start disabled. The build and tests never run providers.

CP-OS keeps ordering, retention, resume, budget and delivery, as for the command line.
Delivery rereads the module handoffs and reuses the report renderer, and is hash-checked.
No separate CP-MEMO execution is added.

Drafts live under `<workspace>/intake/<run-id>`. Execution, including response records,
handoffs and the verified delivery, lives under `runs/<run-id>`. The app creates these
standard parent folders in a new writable workspace. Existing run destinations are not
overwritten. A stopped web run shows the handoffs it accepted and publishes no report. It
is not resumed from the app; the command line can resume the run folder.
A crash/interruption is retained and does not trigger an automatic paid restart.
The worker holds `intake/<run-id>/worker.lock` while it runs. When the app starts again, a run
still marked running whose worker has ended is shown as interrupted; one whose worker is still
running stays active (no second Start, no workspace change) until that worker ends.

The Windows package contains pinned Python 3.13.15 and its dependency wheels,
verified against upstream SHA-256 digests at build time. It needs no Python/pip
installation or launch-time downloads. `Smoke-test.ps1` checks packaged imports,
Windows locking, the workspace read and offline context review; it never starts a model run. Run it
on the target Windows host as part of acceptance. Native Windows execution and
paid model success have not been demonstrated on this macOS build host.

## Standard locations and enterprise configuration

- Install: IT may place the executable in `%ProgramFiles%\FinalWorkflow\IssuerLibrary`.
  The executable writes nothing beside itself and can run from a read-only location.
- Managed configuration: `%ProgramData%\FinalWorkflow\IssuerLibrary\settings.json`.
  If present, it takes precedence and locks workspace changes in the UI/CLI.
- Per-user state: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FinalWorkflow\IssuerLibrary\settings.json`,
  `index.json` and `library.log` (rotated on launch above 1 MiB), and for a moment during a
  relaunch `quit.request` or `quit.answer`.
- Business data: an approved workspace with `data/`, `runs/` and `deliverables/`.
  Windows Known Folder APIs resolve Documents, LocalAppData and ProgramData,
  including folder redirection. No user-specific absolute path is embedded.

Example managed configuration (IT must provision this actual folder and permissions):

```json
{"workspace": "D:\\Research\\FinalWorkflow"}
```

A UNC path is also supported when available. Offline use requires the data to be
locally available: disconnected network shares and cloud placeholders cannot be
read. A moved workspace needs one configuration update. Store the canonical files
in the workspace, not in the index; the index is disposable and rebuilt on launch.
Per-user state must not be redirected to a shared index used by multiple users.

**Local session.** Loopback is shared by every user and process on the machine, so the headers
the app checks (Host, Origin, Sec-Fetch-Site, `X-Issuer-Library`) are not enough on their own.
Sec-Fetch-Site is accepted only as `same-origin` (the app's page, its report and context frames
and its downloads) or `none` (the address the launcher opens), or absent; `same-site` is
refused with 403 like `cross-site`, because a page on another `127.0.0.1` port is the same site
and the SameSite=Strict cookie goes with its requests. Each launch makes a random one-time
ticket and a random session secret (32 bytes each, `crypto/rand`), held in memory only: never
in `library.log`, settings, the index or a response body. The launcher opens
`/launch?ticket=…`; the first GET exchanges the ticket for an `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict;
Path=/` cookie and redirects to `/`, so the ticket leaves the address bar (a HEAD or a wrong
ticket does not spend it; a used ticket is refused). The ticket expires 120 seconds after the
library is ready (after its first discovery): an expired ticket gets the same 403 and is never
accepted, and starting the library again opens a fresh link (see **Relaunch**). On a shared
Linux or macOS host other local users can read the ticket on the command line of the browser
opener (`xdg-open` or `open`) and of a browser it starts, for that short window: until the
browser has exchanged it, 120 seconds at most. Windows is the target platform. The cookie has
no `Secure` flag because plain loopback HTTP has no TLS, and no expiry. Every request except
`/launch` and `/health` (the instance check, which reads no workspace data) needs the cookie,
compared in constant time; without it the answer is 403 "Open Issuer Library from its
launcher…". With `--no-browser` the one-time link is printed on standard output only, for
whoever started the library. Cookies are not separated by port, so the cookie name carries the
port.

**Relaunch.** A second launch asks `/health` and finds its own instance, whose secret it cannot
learn. It asks that instance to quit through the per-user state folder instead: no network
endpoint, and no secret on disk. It creates `quit.request` there (owner-only, holding only its
process id) and waits up to 10 seconds; the running instance looks for it every 250 ms.
- No model run and no run review in flight: the instance deletes the request, lets requests in
  flight finish (3 seconds at most), stops and releases its port. The new launch then starts as
  usual and opens a fresh one-time link; the old browser session ends with the old instance.
- A run or review in flight: the instance keeps running, writes `quit.answer` (no secret, for
  example `busy: 1 run, 0 reviews`) and deletes the request. The new launch deletes the answer,
  shows "Issuer Library is busy (1 run, 0 reviews); wait for it to finish, then start it again."
  and opens nothing.
- No answer in time (an older build, or a hung instance): the new launch withdraws its request
  and says "Issuer Library is already running and did not quit for this launch", with the
  Settings and Task Manager ways to quit it.

Neither side acts while other users can write to the state folder: a group or world write bit
on Linux and macOS (or a folder of another user), and on Windows an access-control entry giving
write access to anyone but the user, SYSTEM and Administrators (`%LOCALAPPDATA%` is private this
way by default). The instance deletes unread a request older than 20 seconds or one that is not
a plain file private to the user (a link is deleted, never followed). A starting instance clears
both files. A discovery or workspace change in progress defers the request to the next look, and
once the instance agrees to quit no review or Start begins (503). With `--workspace` a relaunch
behaves the same and the new instance uses that workspace.

Only enumerated files under the selected workspace can be served. Pinned files
are rechecked when opened. Reports run in an opaque sandbox with external network
access disabled. Only this local application can embed the report; its renderer,
sections and evidence inspector remain available. The embedded view adds a scoped
Deploy VII presentation adapter: the evidence panel opens on demand, laptop reading
uses one column, and narrative citations use Red Hat Text. Hash verification uses
the retained original bytes before that presentation is added. Downloads and
standalone originals remain byte-for-byte unchanged. Legacy self-contained
reports work here. Deliveries that require external scripts/assets need packaging
adaptation; network assets are never silently fetched.

## Discovery and metadata contract

Every immediate subfolder of `runs/` appears, even without structured metadata.
Retained Markdown, text, PDF, HTML, JSON, CSV and XLSX files are listed recursively.
Hidden files and symlinks are not enumerated. Each file must be a regular file at
most 64 MiB; each run is limited to 5,000 listed files. Discovery notices expose
invalid/partial manifests and missing/changed evidence instead of hiding the case.

Every immediate subfolder of `deliverables/` and of a run's `deliveries/` is checked using its existing
`delivery.json` file hashes and `view.json` issuer/run identity. A report is linked
to a run through an explicit matching identity or a checked legacy mapping. Other
deliveries get their own revision row. A shared issuer, folder timestamp or filename
does not establish a run relationship or the latest approved revision.

The embedded legacy adapter retains the existing example's seven curated cases.
It applies only when the exact source hashes and quoted lines match the workspace.
It is not a general financial parser. Additional unstructured runs are discovered
with unknown summary fields. No fictional screening dataset is shipped in the UI.

For new structured metadata, the producer can publish `runs/<run-id>/library.json`
with schema `issuer-library-run/1`. See `run-manifest.example.json`: it is explicitly
fictional and will be rejected until replaced with real hashes and excerpts.
The CP-OS app adapter emits context-labelled metadata for new app runs. Screening
metrics and a verified completeness checklist remain unassessed until supplied. Write the manifest atomically after its
referenced handoffs exist; incomplete writes remain visible as discovery notices.

- `run.id` must equal its folder name. `issuer`, `name` and `identity_source` are
  required. Non-unknown sector requires `sector_source`. Dates are ISO calendar dates.
- Source keys contain letters, digits, underscore or hyphen. Each source contains
  `path` (workspace-relative, forward slashes), `sha256`, 1-based `line` and exact
  `quote`. Paths must stay within `runs/`, `data/` or `deliverables/`.
- `metrics` supports `revenue`, `ebitda`, `leverage`, `coverage`, `cash`, `cashflow`.
  Each supplied metric has a decimal-string `value`, `unit`, `period`, `basis` and
  source key. Units must carry currency/scale where applicable, e.g. `USD m`.
  Keep unavailable values null, distinct from zero. Evidence checks establish
  literal transport, not an independent financial interpretation of the row:
  the value must equal a whole number in the quote, sign and scale included
  (thousands commas group three digits; an accounting `(12.3)` is `-12.3`). A
  fragment of a date, range, list or decimal-comma figure does not count.
  Optional `provenance` is the producer's explicit `cited`, `calculated` or
  `synthetic` classification. Omit it when unknown: the interface shows
  **Not classified** beside the source link. A verified source alone does not
  establish provenance type, and the library never infers it from the value,
  basis or reference name.
- `artifacts` can name explicit workspace-relative delivery folders, labels,
  relationship (`direct` or `related`) and state. The library verifies the actual
  delivery and issuer before enabling a link. The delivery's own status is retained;
  a legacy `superseded` flag remains excluded from primary links.
- `checklist` defaults to null, giving **Not assessed**. To report a score, provide
  `scope` and unique `requirements` with `id`, `stage`, `done`, `evidence` (source
  keys). Required stages: `sources`, `analysis`, `verification`, `downstream`,
  `delivery`. Every done checkpoint must have verified evidence. The score is the
  integer percentage of done/required checkpoints; optional tasks should not be in
  the denominator. This is the producer's scoped assessment, not library approval.
  Report availability and hashes alone never imply analytical completion. A claimed
  delivery checkpoint also requires an available direct report bundle; a missing or
  changed bundle withholds the score rather than preserving stale completion.

## Development and reproducible packaging

Build requires Go 1.26 and Python 3.13. Windows runtime dependencies are bundled.

```sh
cd apps/issuer-library
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
go run . --workspace /absolute/workspace --no-browser
python3 packaging/build.py
```

Packaging uses the local Go toolchain with module downloads disabled. The runtime
packager downloads official Python and pinned PyPI wheels into a verified cache;
rebuilds reuse that cache. No provider execution occurs. Outputs go to
`artifacts/issuer-library` at the repository root. It copies the deliverables'
actual design tokens, styles, brand image and licensed fonts, plus the verified legacy adapter. Screening logic extends the existing example
with exact decimal comparison. Frontend composition lives in `web/`.
Windows amd64/arm64 executables and a macOS arm64 development binary are produced.
No issuer runs, uploaded PDFs, provider credentials or complete reports enter the ZIP.
A clearly fictional context is included only for the explicit offline smoke test.

`--state-dir` provides an isolated state directory for tests. `--port` overrides the stable
per-user loopback port if another application occupies it. A relaunch, with or without
`--workspace`, asks an idle running instance to quit first (see **Relaunch**). `--no-browser`
prints `Issuer Library: http://127.0.0.1:<port>/launch?ticket=…`; open that link once, within
120 seconds (`packaging/smoke_test.py` and `designs/browser_check.py` read it from the pipe and
keep the cookie in memory).

DOM simulation tests (existing optional local jsdom installation). `designs/build.py`
writes their fixture from the curated retained runs and fails if a curated pin goes stale:

```sh
python3 -B designs/build.py
ISSUER_LIBRARY_JSDOM=/tmp/issuer-library-dom-check/node_modules/jsdom node --test designs/design.test.cjs web/new-run.test.cjs web/report-renderer.test.cjs web/context-embed.test.cjs
```

DOM simulation and HTTP checks do not establish browser visual or Windows launcher
acceptance. See the single repository `VERIFICATION.md` record for actual scope.

For macOS development only, set `ISSUER_LIBRARY_PYTHON` to the absolute path of
this project's Python 3.13 environment; `ISSUER_LIBRARY_ENGINE_ROOT` can point to
`apps/issuer-library/engine`. Packaged Windows uses the bundled engine automatically.
Do not turn the loopback application into a remotely exposed multi-user service.

## How the one app is put together

`web/` is the whole front end. `boot.js` reads `/api/catalogue` and `/api/workspace`, then
loads `views.js`, `actions.js` and `screen.js`. If the store cannot be read the app still
opens, states the problem and keeps Settings and Help reachable.

`/api/workspace` asks `engine/bridge.py library` for the store. `engine/store.py` parses
every retained handoff, at the run root or in a run's delivery, for the runs the Go catalogue
discovered; there is one parser. Labels come from the catalogue and the launcher's
`workflow.json`, with hand-written reading labels for the curated runs. `engine/catalog.json`
pins curated visuals to exact files: a pin that no longer matches is dropped and listed under
Settings, and that output falls back to its plain sections. A handoff the parser refuses
stays readable as one flagged block. A file that cannot be read hides its run, also listed.

Reports are served by the Go server under the same sandbox as before and traced to run files
by SHA-256; a handoff with no matching run file is named. All resources are local. No new
analysis is performed, and missing observations are never plotted as zero. See DESIGN.md for
the screens, and the single repository `VERIFICATION.md` for what has actually been checked.
