"""Python statement-line extraction from whitespace-aligned page text (task 8.10).

User decision "A" (24 Oct 2026): Python extracts the printed statement lines and the model maps,
corrects and cites them instead of retyping them. One call reads one page's text and reports
only what is printed: each data line's label, its raw numeric cells and their exact `Decimal`
values, the label's indent, the caption above it and the raw header lines above the first data
line. Every extracted row also carries bounded exact `label_candidates` with their physical
line numbers for a separate source-bound label selection, plus a per-cell indicator of whether
the source printed a currency sign. These fields do not change its legacy label, raw values or
flags. It never rounds and never guesses a unit, period, item, statement or sign convention (the
model maps `period_id` and `item_id`). A line the rules cannot parse is never stubbed as
data; a candidate such line (two or more tokens ending in a numeric cell) is recorded in
`ExtractedTable.omitted` as printed, and prose yields an empty table.

Rules (docs/development/live-runner.md, "Statement extraction"):

- A line's cells are separated by two or more spaces, or by a ` | ` pipe (a table row printed
  as `Label | 1,759 | 1,668`: the line is read as if each pipe were two spaces; a row of only
  `-` runs and pipes gives no line, and a line holding a pipe is never a caption or a label
  continuation). A data line is a label (with a letter)
  followed, to the end of the line, by two or more numeric cells: `10,441`, `2.42`, `(1,234)`
  (negative) or a lone em dash, en dash or hyphen (nil: value `None`, raw token kept). A `$`,
  `£` or `€` before a number, alone or attached, is folded into it and not kept in the raw value.
- Leader dots (runs of two or more `.` or `…`, optionally space-separated; a `.` directly before
  a digit is a decimal point and ends a run) between a label and its values are read as two
  spaces, so the label does not hold them and they do not join cells. A currency sign printed
  one space or none after a digit, or after a `)` or `.` that follows a digit, is split from it
  (`(4.99) $ 5.00`); after a word it is not (`$84 and $108` stays label text).
- A single cell of text with no digit and a lowercase letter, not ending in `:`, directly above
  a data line (no blank line between) continues its label; such lines join the label with one
  space and the indent is the first line's. A line ending in `:` is a sub-heading, not joined.
- A line with a letter, no lowercase letter and no digit is a caption; it applies to the data
  lines that follow until the next caption.
- `headers` are the raw lines nearest above the first data line holding two or more four-digit
  years or a month name, with the adjacent such lines above them (blank lines between allowed).
- A line whose numeric cells are all bare four-digit years from 1900 to 2099 with no `$` is a
  header line, not data, only when its label is empty, wholly parenthesised (`(In millions)`),
  or made only of month names, period words (`Year ended December 31`, `Notes`) and unit or scale
  words (`in millions, except per share data`). Any other label makes it a data line, read like any
  other (`Net revenues  2025  1998`), so `headers` never holds a returned data line.
- `omitted` lists, in page order, each candidate line the rules did not return as data: a
  non-blank line of two or more whitespace-separated tokens (after the pipe rewrite) whose
  last token is a numeric cell, or a printed number the cell rules do not read (a leading ASCII
  or Unicode minus `-1,234` `\u221245`, a percent `12.5%`, a decimal comma or dotted thousands
  `1.234,5`; a last lone `)` or `%` is read with the token before it, so `(250 )` and
  `12.5 %` count), and which holds a letter or digit (a row of only nil dashes and pipes is a
  separator), that is neither a returned data line, a returned header line nor a
  header-shaped line ending in a four-digit year (`2025`, `31,2025`: a second table's period
  row). A lone token (a page number) is never a candidate. Such numbers are never read as
  values here.

Flags (task 8.10b, review risks 1-2) inform the model and never drop a line:

- `more_values_than_header_years`: the line has more numeric cells than the table's header
  lines hold four-digit years (counted over all header lines; none counted when the headers
  name no year). A footnote marker `(1)` two spaces before the values reads as a value of -1.
- `label_ends_numeric`: the label's last token is a numeric cell (`1,234`, `$5`, `(12)`, a nil
  dash, a split `(12 )`) or a minus-signed number (`-120`, `\u2212120`), which stops the scan.
  Two numbers one space apart are one text cell, so the scan stops there and they stay
  in the label; a label ending in a year (`Balance, January 1, 2023`) is flagged too.
- `footnote_marker`: the header lines hold N > 0 four-digit years and the line has N + 1 raw
  values whose first is `(n)`, or a bare `n` when a header line has a cell that is the word Note or
  Notes on its own, starting left of the leftmost year column (one or two digits, no `$`), and
  ends left of the column where the leftmost four-digit year of the
  header lines starts (both read after the pipe rewrite): that first cell is a footnote marker,
  dropped from `raw_values` and `values` (the label is unchanged), and the line does not also get
  `more_values_than_header_years`. A note reference of several numbers (`7 and 9`,
  `8, 9, 11 and 16`) is label text, two or more spaces after the label; under a Note or Notes
  header it counts as the extra cell: the line has N raw values and the reference ends left of
  that column, and it is dropped from the label (the values are unchanged). Rows below a later
  header line that is not a data row are not under the Note column. Both conditions are
  required: a small first value with no extra value, one right of the first year, or one under no
  Note header (a two-column table under one year) is a value. Under a Note column, a row of N
  values whose first is an unsigned bare number of one or two digits left of the years, with a
  sign folded into a later cell, keeps that number in its label and is flagged
  `label_ends_numeric`. With no year in the headers
  the marker `(n)` still reads as -1 and is flagged as above.

`ExtractedTable.source_id` names the table's source: `extract_pack_statements` sets it and
binds locators per source, so two sources may share a locator; `extract_statement_lines` sets
it only when given one.
