"""CP-4 (legal and covenants) owner core, Stage 1: the calculation (docs/CP4-OWNER-LEASE.md).

CP-4 writes no new analytical core: `cp4_legal.covenant_interpretation` composes the 31 tables
and owns every number. This module adds the lease's semantic gate (LEAD ruling Q1 = A) and a pure
`compute` that runs the gate, then the engine's validator, then its composer.

Stage 2 connects it to G1 (rulings stage2 Q3, Q4): the entry validator, the exact `step_context`
view, the verifier probe and the `precheck` hook that runs the semantic gate. `cp4_legal` reads
the bound CP-0/CP-1 heads itself (`upstream_of`), so there is no further store adapter.
