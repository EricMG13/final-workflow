"""Start a CP-OS run from a context file, an issuer folder and a selected model.

Without ``--live`` this only prepares: it pins the inputs, writes ``workflow.json`` with the module
instructions, prints the plan and calls no provider. ``--live`` passes that manifest to
``cpos.run_live_handoffs``, which keeps ordering, retention, resume, budget and delivery.
``--config host`` passes it to ``cpos.run_handoffs`` as a host session: CP-OS stops at each module
whose request has no answer, the host writes the answer beside that request, and the same command
continues. No provider is called.

The generic check here covers handoff structure, issuer/date/source/upstream anchors and report
selectors. It has no independent expected values, so a passing run is not analytical review; every
report says so in its scope. CP-1 fills the chart strip from fixed tables. ponytail: the HTML Model
needs issuer-specific row selectors; add it when a run can derive those from CP-1's actual tables.
