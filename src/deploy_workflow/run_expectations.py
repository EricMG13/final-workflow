"""What a run is expected to do, offline, before Start.

Two parts. `guess_kind` is a conservative guess of an issuer file's document kind from its name and
first pages; a cover phrase on page 1 outranks later pages and the file name, and a page naming two
kinds, or none, is `unrecognised`. `expectations` applies a table of rules to the user's
declarations, the context and those guesses. Both inform; neither blocks a run."""
