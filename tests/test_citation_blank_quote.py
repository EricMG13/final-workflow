"""Stage 2 close release (round 13 addendum 3): `readiness.citation_issues` refuses a blank
quote, whatever the span holds. `quoted` already matches nothing for an empty reading, but a
quote of invisible characters (U+200B, U+2800, a control) is a substring of a span that holds
the same characters."""
