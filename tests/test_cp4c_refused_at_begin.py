"""User ruling: a CP-1 facility issue that no CP-4C response can repair is refused at CP-4C's
begin, before any model call, and the walk continues.

When CP-0 authorizes CP-4C (its `current_inputs` check passes) and CP-1's settled head yields a
CP-4C facility issue (zero or several SECURED T4.18 facilities at the quarter, an alias that
disagrees, no T4.14 period, no single current period, a secured row without its id), the owner
workflow retains `RefusedBegin(CP-4C, <snapshot>, <the issue text>)`: no CP-4C attempt, no model
request, no spend. CP-4C's consumers then see a refused upstream as for any refused module. The
submit outcome names it `cp4c_upstream_fault`. A head with exactly one SECURED facility begins
CP-4C as before; a DO-NOT-RUN or blocked CP-4C keeps its ordinary refusal.

Scope: offline and synthetic. The stores are real `Execution` stores whose CP-0, CP-1, CP-2A and
CP-4 heads are settled through `begin`/`finish` from the CP-4C oracle's records (as
`test_connect_cp4c.seed`; no CP-1 promotion); CP-2G is then begun and submitted through the owner
API (`read_inputs`, `submit_review` with the frozen CP-2G gap literal), and that submit's walk
reaches CP-4C. A sealed `verify_owner_run_receipt` needs every attempt begun through the owner API,
CP-1's promotion included (minutes), so the verifier's walk and refusal checks (`_verify_walk`,
`_verify_refusal`) are run on these journals instead, and a resume is `open()`'s rebuild and
continue steps (`_rebuild_lists`, `_continue_walk`) without its whole-chain reconciliation. A
begun CP-4C step is recorded rather than given its source session (`activations`): that session
checks CP-1's retained promotion chain, which these journals do not hold. No provider is called.
Every expected line is written out by hand from the rows each test writes (as
`tests/test_cp4c_secured_facility.py`).
