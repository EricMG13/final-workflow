"""T2D.8: a High-quality creditor-adverse documented action sets the level High at any count.

r14 CP-2C: no composite unless at least four dimensions are scored, "unless one clearly High-risk
documented action". The action is a floor: adding favourable (Supportive) rows must never lower
the level from High. Expected values follow that rule by hand, not from the code under test.
