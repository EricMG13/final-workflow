"""The repeated-validation theme (S07-cp2-gh-C01 and its duplicates S07-cp2-gh-C02, S06-cp2-ade-C06,
S08-cp3-C10, S10-cp6-cp8-cpl10-C05): one `_validate_step` validates a submission once and composes
it once; the public composers keep their own guard.

Each count is a function that runs once per validation pass or once per composition. A full submit
runs `_validate_step` twice by design (the journal's step validation, then the trusted re-check
before settlement), so the expected counts below are 2 per submit: one validation and one
composition per `_validate_step`. Before the change they were 6 content checks (CP-2G), 6
validation passes and 8 composes (CP-2H), 6 (CP-2A), 6 (CP-2D), 2 per step (CP-2, CP-3, CP-6).
